# Solana / MemeCoin Distribution

## overview

-This Sol/Token distribution works from a single wallet to multiple wallets in a way that remains undetectable by Bubble Maps. The setup works reliably with around 30–35 wallets in maximum.

-It can be customisable with new features
-It is under private mode if you need let's chat on [telegram](https://t.me/roswellecho)
-I've tested it in new creasted 3 wallets. It was undetectable by bubblemap
